Ensure you include the fmt library headers and link against it (or include the source if it's header-only).\n  - Example: `c++ -Iinclude repro_bug.cc src/format.cc -o repro` (adjust paths as needed based on the project structure found in previous tasks).\n- [ ] Run the executable.\n- [ ] Observe the output. Expect assertion failures or output mismatching the expectations defined in Task 12.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] The reproduction script compiles successfully.\n- [ ] The execution confirms the bug (i.e., the assertions fail, or the printed output shows missing padding/signs).\n- [ ] The failure output is documented for the verification phase.\n\n##### Dependencies:\n- Task 12 (Creation of `repro_bug.cc`)\n\n\n### 8. Analyze existing formatting logic (Epic: Implementation)\n\n#### Description\n\nAnalyze how finite floating-point numbers are formatted, specifically how the sign (positive/negative/space) and width/padding are applied. Identify the reusable components or logic that can be applied to NaN/Inf.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Confirm bug reproduction\n    - current (in progress task): Analyze existing formatting logic <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Implement sign handling for NaN/Inf\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nAnalyze the existing codebase to understand how finite floating-point numbers are formatted correctly.\n\n##### Technical Specs:\n- Focus on the logic handling standard numbers (e.g., `123.45`).\n- Determine how the following are applied:\n  - **Sign:** Handling of `+`, `-`, and space ` ` flags.\n  - **Width:** How the total length is calculated and checked.\n  - **Padding/Alignment:** How fill characters are prepended/appended (Left, Right, Center).\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Trace the code path for finite float formatting in `include/fmt/format.h` (or relevant file found in Task 11).\n- [ ] Identify helper functions or logic blocks used for padding and sign insertion.\n- [ ] determine which parts of this logic can be reused or called for the `NaN`/`Inf` branches.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] A clear understanding of the sign and padding logic is established.\n- [ ] Reusable components/methods are identified to apply to the NaN/Inf fix.\n\n##### Files to read:\n- `include/fmt/format.h` (or the file identified in Task 11 containing float formatting logic).\n\n\n### 9. Implement sign handling for NaN/Inf (Epic: Implementation)\n\n#### Description\n\nModify the NaN and Infinity handling logic to correctly detect the sign of the value (using `std::signbit` or similar) and prepend the appropriate sign character ('+', '-', or ' ') based on the format specifier.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Analyze existing formatting logic\n    - current (in progress task): Implement sign handling for NaN/Inf <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Implement padding and alignment for NaN/Inf\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nThis task focuses on correctly handling the sign for `NaN` and `Infinity` values in floating-point formatting, ensuring consistency with finite numbers.\n\n##### Technical Specs:\n- **Location**: Identify the floating-point formatting logic (likely in `include/fmt/format.h` or `src/format.cc`, specifically looking for `format_float` or branches handling `isnan`/`isinf`).\n- **Sign Detection**: Use `std::signbit` (or equivalent portable check) to determine if the value is negative, as `value < 0` returns false for NaN.\n- **Format Specifiers**: Respect the sign specifiers in the format string:\n  - `+`: Always show sign (prepend `+` for positive).\n  - `-`: Only show sign for negative (default behavior).\n  - ` ` (space): Prepend space for positive numbers.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Locate the branch handling NaN and Infinity.\n- [ ] Determine the correct sign character:\n    - If negative (via `signbit`), use `-`.\n    - If positive and `+` flag is set, use `+`.\n    - If positive and ` ` flag is set, use ` ` (space).\n    - Otherwise, no sign.\n- [ ] Prepend the determined sign character to the \"nan\" or \"inf\" string buffer.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] `fmt::format(\"{:+}\", nan)` produces `+nan`.\n- [ ] `fmt::format(\"{: }\", nan)` produces ` nan`.\n- [ ] `fmt::format(\"{}\", -nan)` produces `-nan` (if platform supports signed NaN).\n\n##### Files to modify:\n- `include/fmt/format.h` (or the relevant source file containing float formatting logic).\n\n\n### 10. Implement padding and alignment for NaN/Inf (Epic: Implementation)\n\n#### Description\n\nUpdate the NaN and Infinity formatting to respect the width and alignment specifiers. Ensure that the resulting string is padded to the specified width using the correct fill character and alignment (left, right, center).\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Implement sign handling for NaN/Inf\n    - current (in progress task): Implement padding and alignment for NaN/Inf <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Verify fix with reproduction test\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nThis task focuses on applying width, alignment, and fill specifications to `NaN` and `Infinity` values, which currently may be ignored in the special handling branches.\n\n##### Technical Specs:\n- **Padding**: Ensure the resulting string (including sign) is padded to meet the specified `width`.\n- **Alignment**: Respect the alignment specifiers:\n  - `<`: Left align (pad on right).\n  - `>`: Right align (pad on left).\n  - `^`: Center align.\n- **Fill Character**: Use the specified fill character (default is space).\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Identify where the \"nan\"/\"inf\" string (with sign from Task 15) is finalized.\n- [ ] Calculate the required padding: `padding = width - string_length`.\n- [ ] If `padding > 0`, apply the padding logic based on alignment.\n- [ ] Check if existing helper functions (e.g., `write_padded` or similar internal iterators) can be reused to avoid code duplication.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] `fmt::format(\"{:>6}\", nan)` produces `\"   nan\"`.\n- [ ] `fmt::format(\"{:<6}\", nan)` produces `\"nan   \"`.\n- [ ] `fmt::format(\"{:*^7}\", nan)` produces `\"*nan**\"`.\n\n##### Dependencies:\n- Task 15 (Sign handling) should be integrated so padding accounts for the sign character length.\n\n##### Files to modify:\n- `include/fmt/format.h` (or relevant float formatting implementation).\n\n\n### 11. Verify fix with reproduction test (Epic: Verification)\n\n#### Description\n\nRe-compile and run `repro_bug.cc` with the modified codebase. Verify that all assertions now pass.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Implement padding and alignment for NaN/Inf\n    - current (in progress task): Verify fix with reproduction test <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Regression testing\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nVerify the fixes for formatting NaN and Infinity by running the reproduction test case created earlier.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Compile `repro_bug.cc` linking against the modified `fmt` library.\n    - Ensure include paths are correct (`-Iinclude`).\n- [ ] Run the executable.\n- [ ] Verify that all assertions pass (exit code 0, no assertion failures printed).\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] The reproduction script `repro_bug.cc` runs successfully without errors.\n- [ ] Output confirms that NaN/Inf formatting now respects sign, width, and alignment.\n\n##### Files to read:\n- `repro_bug.cc`\n\n\n### 12. Regression testing (Epic: Verification)\n\n#### Description\n\nRun the existing test suite (e.g., `make test` or `ctest`) to ensure that the changes have not introduced any regressions in other parts of the library, especially for standard floating-point formatting.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Verify fix with reproduction test\n    - current (in progress task): Regression testing <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): N/A\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nPerform regression testing to ensure that the changes to floating-point formatting logic (specifically the NaN/Inf branches) have not negatively impacted standard floating-point formatting or other library features.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Run the project's standard test suite.\n    - Common commands: `make test`, `ctest`, or executing the main test binary (e.g., `bin/test` or similar).\n- [ ] Analyze the output for any failures.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] All existing tests pass.\n- [ ] No regressions in finite number formatting (e.g., normal doubles/floats still format correctly).\n\n##### Files to read:\n- `CMakeLists.txt` (to identify how to run tests)\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\n\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n<IMPORTANT>This is an interactive process where you will think and issue AT LEAST ONE command, see the result, then think and issue your next command(s).</important>\n\nFor each response:\n\n1.

It also seems to handle the sign.\n\nHowever, the issue description says:\n> Preceding the width field by a zero ('0') character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types. ... This option is only valid for numeric types and ***it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN.***\n\nAnd the example:\n```CPP\nfmt::print(\"'{:+06}'\\n\", NAN);\n// output: '00+nan'\n```\nWait, the output `00+nan` suggests that zero padding IS applied, but maybe not correctly? Or maybe the user expects `  +nan`?\n\nAh, looking at the example again:\n```CPP\nfmt::print(\"'{:+06}'\\n\", NAN);\n// output: '00+nan'\n```\nThe user says \"Numeric zero fill is applied to inf/nan\". And quotes documentation saying \"it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN\".\n\nSo the bug is that it *does* have an effect (it prints `00+nan`), but it *should not* (it should print `  +nan` or similar, treating it as a string/non-numeric for padding purposes, or at least not zero-padding it like a number).\n\nWait, if I use `+06`, it means:\n- `+`: show sign\n- `0`: zero pad\n- `6`: width 6\n\nIf I have `NAN`, it is 3 chars. With `+`, it is 4 chars `+nan`.\nWidth 6 means 2 chars padding.\nIf zero padding is enabled, it pads with `0`. So `00+nan`.\n\nThe documentation says: \"This option [zero padding] is only valid for numeric types and it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN.\"\n\nSo `fmt` claims it has no effect, but in reality it does (producing `00+nan`). The expected behavior for `NAN` with `0` flag should probably be to ignore the `0` flag and use space padding, because `NAN` is not a number in the sense of digits.\n\nSo `fmt::format(\"{:+06}\", nan)` should probably produce `  +nan` (space padded) instead of `00+nan`.\n\nLet's verify this with a reproduction script.\n\nI'll create `repro_bug.cc`.",

Specifically:\n1. If `specs.align` is `align::numeric`, it should be changed to `align::right` (or whatever the default alignment is for non-numeric types, or maybe just right alignment since it's still a number type but formatted as string).\n2. If `specs.fill[0]` is `0` and `specs.align` was `numeric`, it should probably be changed to space.\n\nWait, `align::numeric` implies padding is placed after the sign but before the digits. `write_padded` handles `align::numeric`?\n\nLet's check `write_padded` again.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <align::type align = align::left, typename OutputIt, typename Char,\n          typename F>\nFMT_CONSTEXPR OutputIt write_padded(OutputIt out,\n                                    const basic_format_specs<Char>&",

Specifically:\n1. If `specs.align` is `align::numeric`, it should be changed to `align::right` (or whatever the default alignment is for non-numeric types, or maybe just right alignment since it's still a number type but formatted as string).\n2. If `specs.fill[0]` is `0` and `specs.align` was `numeric`, it should probably be changed to space.\n\nWait, `align::numeric` implies padding is placed after the sign but before the digits. `write_padded` handles `align::numeric`?\n\nLet's check `write_padded` again.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <align::type align = align::left, typename OutputIt, typename Char,\n          typename F>\nFMT_CONSTEXPR OutputIt write_padded(OutputIt out,\n                                    const basic_format_specs<Char>&",

This option is only valid for numeric types and it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN.\n\nThis refers to the `0` flag (the one that sets `align::numeric`).\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say that explicit fill `0` with alignment (e.g. `{:0>6}`) should be ignored for NaN/Inf, but usually NaN/Inf are treated as strings for formatting purposes when they are not numbers.\n\nHowever, the specific complaint is about the `0` flag.\n\nSo, in `write_nonfinite`, I should detect if `specs.align == align::numeric`. If so, I should revert to default alignment (right) and default fill (space).\n\nLet's verify what `align::numeric` implies.

If `align::numeric`, it pads on the left.\nThe sign is written *inside* the callback passed to `write_padded`.\nSo `write_padded` writes padding, then calls callback.\nCallback writes sign, then string.\n\nSo we get `00+nan`.\n\nIf we want `+00nan` (which is what `align::numeric` usually does for numbers), `write_padded` isn't doing that. `write_padded` just pads on left.\n\nFor normal numbers, `write_float` handles `align::numeric` specially?\n\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric && fspecs.sign) {\n    auto it = reserve(out, 1);\n    *it++ = static_cast<Char>(data::signs[fspecs.sign]);\n    out = base_iterator(out, it);\n    fspecs.sign = sign::none;\n    if (specs.width != 0) --specs.width;\n  }\n```\n\nYes, `write_float` (lines 1788-1794 in `include/fmt/format.h` based on previous `grep` context, but let's verify) handles `align::numeric` by writing the sign *before* calling `write_padded` (or whatever follows).\n\nWait, `write_nonfinite` is called *before* this block in `write_float`?\n\nLet's check `write_float` in `include/fmt/format.h`.",

So I should use `Char(' ')`.\n\n```cpp\n  auto specs_copy = specs;\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    specs_copy.align = align::right;\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == Char('0')) {\n       specs_copy.fill[0] = Char(' ');\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nWait, `align::numeric` is only set by `0` flag if I recall correctly.\nIf user does `{:0>6}`, `align` is `right` and fill is `0`.\nIn that case, `align` is NOT `numeric`.\n\nThe issue description says:\n> Preceding the width field by a zero ('0') character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types. ... This option is only valid for numeric types and it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN.\n\nSo only the `0` flag (which sets `align::numeric`) should be ignored.\nExplicit fill `0` with alignment (e.g. `{:0>6}`) is NOT the `0` flag. It is explicit fill.\nUsually explicit fill is respected even for strings. e.g. `fmt::format(\"{:0>6}\", \"foo\")` -> `000foo`.\nSo `fmt::format(\"{:0>6}\", nan)` -> `000nan` is probably correct behavior because `nan` is treated as a string here.\n\nBut `fmt::format(\"{:06}\", nan)` uses the `0` flag, which implies `align::numeric`. This is what should be ignored.\n\nSo checking `specs.align == align::numeric` is the correct condition.\n\nIf `specs.align == align::numeric`, we should revert to default alignment (right) and default fill (space).\n\nWait, if I change `align` to `right`, I should also reset fill to space IF it was set to `0` by the `0` flag.\nThe `0` flag sets fill to `0`.\n\nSo:\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == Char('0')) {\n       specs_copy.fill[0] = Char(' ');\n    }\n    specs_copy.align = align::right;\n  }\n```\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nNow I need to apply this change to `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\nI'll read `include/fmt/format.h` again to make sure I have the context right.",

                "content": "`fill_t` stores the fill characters directly (up to 4).\n\nSo I can just modify it.\n\n```cpp\n  auto specs_copy = specs;\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    specs_copy.align = align::right;\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == '0') {\n       specs_copy.fill[0] = ' ';\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nWait, `Char` might be `wchar_t`. So I should use `Char(' ')`.\n\n```cpp\n  auto specs_copy = specs;\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    specs_copy.align = align::right;\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == Char('0')) {\n       specs_copy.fill[0] = Char(' ');\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nWait, `align::numeric` is only set by `0` flag if I recall correctly.\nIf user does `{:0>6}`, `align` is `right` and fill is `0`.\nIn that case, `align` is NOT `numeric`.\n\nThe issue description says:\n> Preceding the width field by a zero ('0') character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types. ... This option is only valid for numeric types and it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN.\n\nSo only the `0` flag (which sets `align::numeric`) should be ignored.\nExplicit fill `0` with alignment (e.g. `{:0>6}`) is NOT the `0` flag. It is explicit fill.\nUsually explicit fill is respected even for strings. e.g. `fmt::format(\"{:0>6}\", \"foo\")` -> `000foo`.\nSo `fmt::format(\"{:0>6}\", nan)` -> `000nan` is probably correct behavior because `nan` is treated as a string here.\n\nBut `fmt::format(\"{:06}\", nan)` uses the `0` flag, which implies `align::numeric`. This is what should be ignored.\n\nSo checking `specs.align == align::numeric` is the correct condition.\n\nIf `specs.align == align::numeric`, we should revert to default alignment (right) and default fill (space).\n\nWait, if I change `align` to `right`, I should also reset fill to space IF it was set to `0` by the `0` flag.\nThe `0` flag sets fill to `0`.\n\nSo:\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == Char('0')) {\n       specs_copy.fill[0] = Char(' ');\n    }\n    specs_copy.align = align::right;\n  }\n```\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nNow I need to apply this change to `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\nI'll read `include/fmt/format.h` again to make sure I have the context right.",

      "content": "So for normal numbers, `0` flag overrides alignment completely. `\"{:<+06}\"` behaves exactly like `\"{:+06}\"`.\n\nIf the documentation says \"it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN\", then `\"{:<+06}\"` should behave like `\"{:<+6}\"` for NaN/Inf.\n\nBut `\"{:<+6}\"` produces `+nan  `.\n\nIf `0` flag overrides alignment, then `\"{:<+06}\"` becomes `align::numeric`.\n\nIf we ignore `0` flag for NaN/Inf, we should revert to the alignment that was specified *before* the `0` flag.\n\nBut we lost that information!\n\nThis means `basic_format_specs` needs to store the original alignment separately from the `0` flag effect.\n\nOr, `align::numeric` should be separate from `align::left/right/center`.\n\nBut `align` is an enum with 4 bits.\n\nWait, `align::numeric` is just one value in the enum.\n\nIf we want to fix this properly, we might need to change `basic_format_specs` or how `0` flag is handled.\n\nHowever, changing `basic_format_specs` is a big change.\n\nIs there any other way?\n\nMaybe `parse_format_specs` can be smarter?\n\nIf `0` flag is encountered, it sets `align = numeric`.\n\nIf we want to preserve the original alignment, we need to store it somewhere.\n\nWait, `basic_format_specs` has `align_t align : 4`.\n\nIf we look at `parse_align`:\n```cpp\n    case '<':\n      align = align::left;\n      break;\n```\nIt sets `align`.\n\nThen `parse_format_specs`:\n```cpp\n  begin = parse_align(begin, end, handler);\n  // ...\n  if (*begin == '0') {\n    handler.on_zero();\n```\n\n`handler.on_zero()`:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nIt overwrites `align`.\n\nIf we want to support `\"{:<+06}\"` for NaN/Inf, we need to know that `<` was specified.\n\nBut wait, if `0` flag is ignored for NaN/Inf, then `\"{:<+06}\"` should be treated as `\"{:<+6}\"`.\n\nIf `fmt` cannot distinguish `\"{:<+06}\"` from `\"{:+06}\"` (both result in `align::numeric`), then we cannot implement the fix fully correctly for alignment cases without changing `basic_format_specs`.\n\nHowever, maybe we can infer the alignment? No.\n\nLet's check if `basic_format_specs` has any unused bits or fields.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename Char> struct basic_format_specs {\n  int width;\n  int precision;\n  char type;\n  align_t align : 4;\n  sign_t sign : 3;\n  bool alt : 1;  // Alternate form ('#').\n  bool localized : 1;\n  detail::fill_t<Char> fill;\n```\n\nIt seems packed.\n\nBut wait, `align_t` has values `none`, `left`, `right`, `center`, `numeric`. That's 5 values. 3 bits are enough. 4 bits are allocated.\n\nMaybe we can add another flag `zero_padding` instead of using `align::numeric`?\n\nBut `align::numeric` is used throughout the codebase to mean \"numeric alignment\".\n\nIf we change `align::numeric` to be a separate flag, we would need to update all usage sites.\n\nAlternatively, we can store the original alignment in `align` and use a separate bit for `zero_padding`.\n\nBut `basic_format_specs` is public API. Changing its layout might break ABI if it's part of the stable ABI. `fmt` claims ABI stability in some versions.\n\nHowever, the task is to fix the bug.\n\nIf I cannot change `basic_format_specs`, maybe I can change how `align::numeric` is used.\n\nIf `align::numeric` is set, it means \"numeric alignment\".\n\nFor NaN/Inf, \"numeric alignment\" is not applicable.\n\nIf the user specified `\"{:<+06}\"`, they are asking for left alignment AND numeric alignment (via `0`). These are conflicting. `fmt` resolves conflict by letting `0` win.\n\nIf `0` wins, then alignment is numeric.\n\nIf we ignore `0` for NaN/Inf, we are left with... what?\n\nIf we assume that `0` flag implies \"default alignment if not for 0\", then we fall back to right alignment (default for numbers).\n\nBut `\"{:<+06}\"` explicitly asks for left alignment.\n\nIf `fmt` drops the left alignment information during parsing, then we can't recover it.\n\nWait, is it possible that `parse_align` is called *after* `0` flag?\nNo, `parse_align` is called first.\n\n```cpp\n  begin = parse_align(begin, end, handler);\n  // ...\n  if (*begin == '0') {\n```\n\nSo `0` comes after alignment.\n\nIf the user writes `\"{:0<6}\"`, that's explicit fill `0` and left align. `parse_align` handles this. `align` becomes `left`, fill becomes `0`. `on_zero` is NOT called because `0` is consumed by `parse_align` as fill char.\n\nWait, `parse_align` logic:\n\n```cpp\n    if (align != align::none) {\n      if (p != begin) {\n        // ...\n        handler.on_fill(...);\n        begin = p + 1;\n      } else\n        ++begin;\n      handler.on_align(align);\n      break;\n    }\n```\n\nIf format is `\"{:<+06}\"`:\n`parse_align` sees `<`. `align` is `left`. `p == begin`. `handler.on_align(left)`. `begin` increments past `<`.\n\nThen `parse_format_specs` continues.\n`+` is parsed as sign.\n`0` is parsed as zero flag. `handler.on_zero()`.\n\n`on_zero` overwrites `align` with `numeric`.\n\nSo yes, the information is lost.\n\nIf we want to fix this, we MUST preserve the alignment.\n\nWe can modify `basic_format_specs` to add a `bool zero_padding` field, and stop using `align::numeric` to represent the `0` flag, OR use `align::numeric` only when no other alignment is specified?\n\nIf we change `on_zero` to:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    // If alignment is already set (and not none), don't overwrite it?\n    // But 0 flag usually overrides alignment for numbers.\n    // If we want to support \"{:<+06}\" for numbers as \"+00001\", then alignment IS numeric (padding between sign and digits).\n    // Left alignment of \"+00001\" is meaningless if width is fully used by zero padding.\n    // But if width is larger, e.g. \"{:<+06}\" with value 1 (width 1). Result \"+00001\".\n    \n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nThe issue is that for NaN/Inf, we want to ignore the `0` flag's effect on alignment.\n\nIf we can't change `basic_format_specs`, we are stuck with `align::numeric`.\n\nHowever, maybe we can assume that if `align::numeric` is set, the user *intended* numeric alignment, which defaults to right alignment for non-numeric strings (like NaN/Inf).\n\nSo `\"{:<+06}\"` resulting in `  +nan` (right aligned) is \"correct\" in the sense that `0` flag forced numeric alignment, which behaves like right alignment for strings.\n\nBut the user expects `+nan  ` because they specified `<`.\n\nIf the documentation says \"it has no effect\", then `\"{:<+06}\"` should be `\"{:<+6}\"`.\n\nThis implies that `fmt`'s parsing logic is \"too aggressive\" in overwriting alignment for `0` flag, OR `basic_format_specs` is insufficient to represent \"Left align BUT use zero padding if numeric\".\n\nIf I look at `include/fmt/core.h`, `basic_format_specs` has `align_t align : 4`.\n\nIf I can't change the struct, I can't fix the alignment issue for `\"{:<+06}\"`.\n\nBUT, wait. `align::numeric` is 4. `align::left` is 1.\n\nIf I change `on_zero` to NOT overwrite `align` if it's already set?\n\nIf `align` is `left`, and `on_zero` is called.\nIf we keep `align` as `left`, but set `fill` to `0`.\nThen `write_padded` will use `left` alignment and `0` fill.\nResult: `+nan00`.\n\nThis is NOT what we want for numbers. For numbers we want `+00001`.\n`+00001` is effectively right aligned (padding on left) but padding is placed after sign.\n\nSo `align::numeric` is a special alignment.\n\nIf we want to support both, we need to know both \"numeric padding requested\" AND \"alignment requested\".\n\nSince `basic_format_specs` is the interface between parsing and formatting, and it's likely fixed, we might be limited.\n\nHowever, let's check if `basic_format_specs` is indeed fixed ABI.\nThe PR description doesn't mention ABI stability constraints, but usually libraries try to avoid breaking it.\n\nBut wait, `fmt` 10.0 might have broken ABI.\n\nIf I can modify `basic_format_specs`, I would add `bool numeric_align` or similar.\n\nLet's see if I can find any unused bits.\n`sign_t` is 3 bits (values 0-3).\n`align_t` is 4 bits (values 0-4).\n\n`basic_format_specs` layout:\n```cpp\n  int width;\n  int precision;\n  char type;\n  align_t align : 4;\n  sign_t sign : 3;\n  bool alt : 1;\n  bool localized : 1;\n  detail::fill_t<Char> fill;\n```\n\n`align` (4) + `sign` (3) + `alt` (1) = 8 bits.\n`localized` (1) -> starts new byte? Or packed?\nUsually bitfields are packed into integer types.\n\nIf I add `bool zero_padding : 1;` it might fit if there is space.\n\nBut changing `basic_format_specs` requires recompiling everything that uses `fmt`.\n\nLet's assume I should try to fix it without changing `basic_format_specs` if possible.\n\nIf I can't preserve the alignment, then `\"{:<+06}\"` -> `  +nan` is the best I can do (ignoring zero padding but falling back to default alignment).\n\nIs `  +nan` better than `00+nan`? Yes.\nIs it perfect? No, because it ignores `<`.\n\nBut maybe `\"{:<+06}\"` is invalid/undefined if `0` flag is used?\nThe docs say `0` flag is \"only valid for numeric types\".\nAnd \"it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN\".\n\nIf it has no effect, then `\"{:<+06}\"` should be `\"{:<+6}\"`.\n\nIf `fmt` parsing destroys the `<` info, then `fmt` parsing is non-compliant with \"has no effect\" (because it has the effect of destroying alignment info).\n\nSo the fix should ideally be in parsing.\n\nIn `on_zero()`:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nIf we change this to:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    // If alignment is already set, we might want to keep it?\n    // But we need to signal \"numeric padding\".\n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nIf we change `align` enum to include `numeric_left`, `numeric_center`?\n`align` is 4 bits, so up to 16 values. Currently used 0-4.\nWe have plenty of space in `align_t`.\n\nSo I can add `numeric_left`, `numeric_right` (redundant with numeric?), `numeric_center`.\n\n`align::numeric` currently behaves like `right` but with special handling in `write_float`.\n\nIf I add `align::numeric_left` (value 5), `align::numeric_center` (value 6).\n\nThen in `on_zero`:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    if (specs_.align == align::left) specs_.align = align::numeric_left;\n    else if (specs_.align == align::center) specs_.align = align::numeric_center;\n    else specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nThen in `write_float`, I need to handle `numeric_left` and `numeric_center`.\nBut `write_float` logic for `numeric` is:\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric && fspecs.sign) {\n     // write sign\n     // reduce width\n     // set sign to none\n  }\n  // write padded (which uses align::numeric -> right align)\n```\n\nIf `align` is `numeric_left`, `write_padded` needs to handle it.\n`write_padded` uses `shifts` array. I need to update `shifts` array.\n\n`left_padding_shifts`:\n`numeric` (4) -> 0 (left padding).\n`numeric_left` (5) -> 31 (right padding).\n\nSo `numeric_left` would behave like `left` in `write_padded`.\n\nAnd in `write_float`, we treat `numeric_left` same as `numeric` (extract sign).\n\nAnd in `write_nonfinite`:\nIf `align` is `numeric`, change to `right`.\nIf `align` is `numeric_left`, change to `left`.\nIf `align` is `numeric_center`, change to `center`.\n\nThis seems like a viable plan that preserves ABI (assuming `align_t` values are not part of ABI contract in a way that forbids adding new values, and `shifts` arrays are internal).\n\n`align` enum is in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n`shifts` arrays are in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\nLet's check `align` enum again.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric };\n}\n```\n\nI can add `numeric_left`, `numeric_center`.\n\nWait, `align::type` is used in `write_padded` template parameter.\n```cpp\ntemplate <align::type align = align::left, ...>\n```\n\nIf I add values, I need to make sure `write_padded` handles them.\n\n`write_padded` implementation:\n```cpp\n  auto* shifts = align == align::left ? data::left_padding_shifts\n                                      : data::right_padding_shifts;\n  size_t left_padding = padding >> shifts[specs.align];\n```\n\nIt uses `specs.align` to index into `shifts`.\nSo I need to extend `shifts` arrays.\n\n`shifts` arrays are `static constexpr const char`.\n\n```cpp\n  FMT_API static constexpr const char left_padding_shifts[] = {31, 31, 0, 1, 0};\n```\n\nI need to extend them to handle new enum values.\n\nThis seems like a clean solution.\n\nLet's verify where `align` enum is defined. `include/fmt/core.h`.\n\nI will modify `include/fmt/core.h` to add `numeric_left` and `numeric_center`.\nThen modify `include/fmt/format.h` to update `left_padding_shifts` and `right_padding_shifts`.\nThen modify `on_zero` in `include/fmt/core.h` (via `specs_setter` or `dynamic_specs_handler`?).\nWait, `on_zero` is in `specs_setter` in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n\nAnd finally update `write_nonfinite` in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\nAlso need to check if `write_float` needs updates.\n`write_float` checks `specs.align == align::numeric`.\nI should update it to check `specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center`.\n\nOr maybe I can define a helper `is_numeric(align)`.\n\nLet's start by modifying `align` enum.\n\nWait, `align` enum is inside `namespace align`.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric };\n}\n```\n\nI'll add `numeric_left` and `numeric_center`.\n\nBut wait, `write_padded` template parameter `align` defaults to `align::left`.\nThe `align` template parameter is used to select which shift array to use?\nNo, `align` template parameter seems to be optimization or something?\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <align::type align = align::left, typename OutputIt, typename Char,\n          typename F>\nFMT_CONSTEXPR OutputIt write_padded(OutputIt out,\n                                    const basic_format_specs<Char>& specs,\n                                    size_t size, size_t width, F&& f) {\n  static_assert(align == align::left || align == align::right, \"\");\n  // ...\n  auto* shifts = align == align::left ? data::left_padding_shifts\n                                      : data::right_padding_shifts;\n```\n\nThe `align` template parameter is strictly `left` or `right`. It selects the \"base\" alignment logic (left aligned or right aligned output?).\nActually it selects which shift table to use.\n\nIf `align == align::left`, it uses `left_padding_shifts`.\n`left_padding_shifts` defines how much left padding to add for each `specs.align`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `left` (1): `shifts[1]` is 31. `padding >> 31` is 0. So 0 left padding. Correct.\nIf `specs.align` is `right` (2): `shifts[2]` is 0. `padding >> 0` is `padding`. So full left padding. Correct.\n\nSo I just need to add entries to `shifts` arrays.\n\nPlan:\n1. Modify `include/fmt/core.h`: Add `numeric_left`, `numeric_center` to `align::type`.\n2. Modify `include/fmt/core.h`: Update `specs_setter::on_zero` to set `numeric_left`/`numeric_center` if `align` is `left`/`center`.\n3. Modify `include/fmt/format.h`: Update `left_padding_shifts` and `right_padding_shifts` arrays.\n4. Modify `include/fmt/format.h`: Update `write_nonfinite` to handle new align values (map them back to `left`/`center`/`right`).\n5. Modify `include/fmt/format.h`: Update `write_float` (and `write_int`?) to handle new align values (treat them as numeric).\n\nWait, `write_int` also uses `align::numeric`. I should check `write_int` too.\n\nLet's check `write_int` (or `write_integer`).\n\nI'll search for `write_int` or similar.",

                "content": "So for normal numbers, `0` flag overrides alignment completely. `\"{:<+06}\"` behaves exactly like `\"{:+06}\"`.\n\nIf the documentation says \"it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN\", then `\"{:<+06}\"` should behave like `\"{:<+6}\"` for NaN/Inf.\n\nBut `\"{:<+6}\"` produces `+nan  `.\n\nIf `0` flag overrides alignment, then `\"{:<+06}\"` becomes `align::numeric`.\n\nIf we ignore `0` flag for NaN/Inf, we should revert to the alignment that was specified *before* the `0` flag.\n\nBut we lost that information!\n\nThis means `basic_format_specs` needs to store the original alignment separately from the `0` flag effect.\n\nOr, `align::numeric` should be separate from `align::left/right/center`.\n\nBut `align` is an enum with 4 bits.\n\nWait, `align::numeric` is just one value in the enum.\n\nIf we want to fix this properly, we might need to change `basic_format_specs` or how `0` flag is handled.\n\nHowever, changing `basic_format_specs` is a big change.\n\nIs there any other way?\n\nMaybe `parse_format_specs` can be smarter?\n\nIf `0` flag is encountered, it sets `align = numeric`.\n\nIf we want to preserve the original alignment, we need to store it somewhere.\n\nWait, `basic_format_specs` has `align_t align : 4`.\n\nIf we look at `parse_align`:\n```cpp\n    case '<':\n      align = align::left;\n      break;\n```\nIt sets `align`.\n\nThen `parse_format_specs`:\n```cpp\n  begin = parse_align(begin, end, handler);\n  // ...\n  if (*begin == '0') {\n    handler.on_zero();\n```\n\n`handler.on_zero()`:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nIt overwrites `align`.\n\nIf we want to support `\"{:<+06}\"` for NaN/Inf, we need to know that `<` was specified.\n\nBut wait, if `0` flag is ignored for NaN/Inf, then `\"{:<+06}\"` should be treated as `\"{:<+6}\"`.\n\nIf `fmt` cannot distinguish `\"{:<+06}\"` from `\"{:+06}\"` (both result in `align::numeric`), then we cannot implement the fix fully correctly for alignment cases without changing `basic_format_specs`.\n\nHowever, maybe we can infer the alignment? No.\n\nLet's check if `basic_format_specs` has any unused bits or fields.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename Char> struct basic_format_specs {\n  int width;\n  int precision;\n  char type;\n  align_t align : 4;\n  sign_t sign : 3;\n  bool alt : 1;  // Alternate form ('#').\n  bool localized : 1;\n  detail::fill_t<Char> fill;\n```\n\nIt seems packed.\n\nBut wait, `align_t` has values `none`, `left`, `right`, `center`, `numeric`. That's 5 values. 3 bits are enough. 4 bits are allocated.\n\nMaybe we can add another flag `zero_padding` instead of using `align::numeric`?\n\nBut `align::numeric` is used throughout the codebase to mean \"numeric alignment\".\n\nIf we change `align::numeric` to be a separate flag, we would need to update all usage sites.\n\nAlternatively, we can store the original alignment in `align` and use a separate bit for `zero_padding`.\n\nBut `basic_format_specs` is public API. Changing its layout might break ABI if it's part of the stable ABI. `fmt` claims ABI stability in some versions.\n\nHowever, the task is to fix the bug.\n\nIf I cannot change `basic_format_specs`, maybe I can change how `align::numeric` is used.\n\nIf `align::numeric` is set, it means \"numeric alignment\".\n\nFor NaN/Inf, \"numeric alignment\" is not applicable.\n\nIf the user specified `\"{:<+06}\"`, they are asking for left alignment AND numeric alignment (via `0`). These are conflicting. `fmt` resolves conflict by letting `0` win.\n\nIf `0` wins, then alignment is numeric.\n\nIf we ignore `0` for NaN/Inf, we are left with... what?\n\nIf we assume that `0` flag implies \"default alignment if not for 0\", then we fall back to right alignment (default for numbers).\n\nBut `\"{:<+06}\"` explicitly asks for left alignment.\n\nIf `fmt` drops the left alignment information during parsing, then we can't recover it.\n\nWait, is it possible that `parse_align` is called *after* `0` flag?\nNo, `parse_align` is called first.\n\n```cpp\n  begin = parse_align(begin, end, handler);\n  // ...\n  if (*begin == '0') {\n```\n\nSo `0` comes after alignment.\n\nIf the user writes `\"{:0<6}\"`, that's explicit fill `0` and left align. `parse_align` handles this. `align` becomes `left`, fill becomes `0`. `on_zero` is NOT called because `0` is consumed by `parse_align` as fill char.\n\nWait, `parse_align` logic:\n\n```cpp\n    if (align != align::none) {\n      if (p != begin) {\n        // ...\n        handler.on_fill(...);\n        begin = p + 1;\n      } else\n        ++begin;\n      handler.on_align(align);\n      break;\n    }\n```\n\nIf format is `\"{:<+06}\"`:\n`parse_align` sees `<`. `align` is `left`. `p == begin`. `handler.on_align(left)`. `begin` increments past `<`.\n\nThen `parse_format_specs` continues.\n`+` is parsed as sign.\n`0` is parsed as zero flag. `handler.on_zero()`.\n\n`on_zero` overwrites `align` with `numeric`.\n\nSo yes, the information is lost.\n\nIf we want to fix this, we MUST preserve the alignment.\n\nWe can modify `basic_format_specs` to add a `bool zero_padding` field, and stop using `align::numeric` to represent the `0` flag, OR use `align::numeric` only when no other alignment is specified?\n\nIf we change `on_zero` to:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    // If alignment is already set (and not none), don't overwrite it?\n    // But 0 flag usually overrides alignment for numbers.\n    // If we want to support \"{:<+06}\" for numbers as \"+00001\", then alignment IS numeric (padding between sign and digits).\n    // Left alignment of \"+00001\" is meaningless if width is fully used by zero padding.\n    // But if width is larger, e.g. \"{:<+06}\" with value 1 (width 1). Result \"+00001\".\n    \n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nThe issue is that for NaN/Inf, we want to ignore the `0` flag's effect on alignment.\n\nIf we can't change `basic_format_specs`, we are stuck with `align::numeric`.\n\nHowever, maybe we can assume that if `align::numeric` is set, the user *intended* numeric alignment, which defaults to right alignment for non-numeric strings (like NaN/Inf).\n\nSo `\"{:<+06}\"` resulting in `  +nan` (right aligned) is \"correct\" in the sense that `0` flag forced numeric alignment, which behaves like right alignment for strings.\n\nBut the user expects `+nan  ` because they specified `<`.\n\nIf the documentation says \"it has no effect\", then `\"{:<+06}\"` should be `\"{:<+6}\"`.\n\nThis implies that `fmt`'s parsing logic is \"too aggressive\" in overwriting alignment for `0` flag, OR `basic_format_specs` is insufficient to represent \"Left align BUT use zero padding if numeric\".\n\nIf I look at `include/fmt/core.h`, `basic_format_specs` has `align_t align : 4`.\n\nIf I can't change the struct, I can't fix the alignment issue for `\"{:<+06}\"`.\n\nBUT, wait. `align::numeric` is 4. `align::left` is 1.\n\nIf I change `on_zero` to NOT overwrite `align` if it's already set?\n\nIf `align` is `left`, and `on_zero` is called.\nIf we keep `align` as `left`, but set `fill` to `0`.\nThen `write_padded` will use `left` alignment and `0` fill.\nResult: `+nan00`.\n\nThis is NOT what we want for numbers. For numbers we want `+00001`.\n`+00001` is effectively right aligned (padding on left) but padding is placed after sign.\n\nSo `align::numeric` is a special alignment.\n\nIf we want to support both, we need to know both \"numeric padding requested\" AND \"alignment requested\".\n\nSince `basic_format_specs` is the interface between parsing and formatting, and it's likely fixed, we might be limited.\n\nHowever, let's check if `basic_format_specs` is indeed fixed ABI.\nThe PR description doesn't mention ABI stability constraints, but usually libraries try to avoid breaking it.\n\nBut wait, `fmt` 10.0 might have broken ABI.\n\nIf I can modify `basic_format_specs`, I would add `bool numeric_align` or similar.\n\nLet's see if I can find any unused bits.\n`sign_t` is 3 bits (values 0-3).\n`align_t` is 4 bits (values 0-4).\n\n`basic_format_specs` layout:\n```cpp\n  int width;\n  int precision;\n  char type;\n  align_t align : 4;\n  sign_t sign : 3;\n  bool alt : 1;\n  bool localized : 1;\n  detail::fill_t<Char> fill;\n```\n\n`align` (4) + `sign` (3) + `alt` (1) = 8 bits.\n`localized` (1) -> starts new byte? Or packed?\nUsually bitfields are packed into integer types.\n\nIf I add `bool zero_padding : 1;` it might fit if there is space.\n\nBut changing `basic_format_specs` requires recompiling everything that uses `fmt`.\n\nLet's assume I should try to fix it without changing `basic_format_specs` if possible.\n\nIf I can't preserve the alignment, then `\"{:<+06}\"` -> `  +nan` is the best I can do (ignoring zero padding but falling back to default alignment).\n\nIs `  +nan` better than `00+nan`? Yes.\nIs it perfect? No, because it ignores `<`.\n\nBut maybe `\"{:<+06}\"` is invalid/undefined if `0` flag is used?\nThe docs say `0` flag is \"only valid for numeric types\".\nAnd \"it has no effect on formatting of infinity and NaN\".\n\nIf it has no effect, then `\"{:<+06}\"` should be `\"{:<+6}\"`.\n\nIf `fmt` parsing destroys the `<` info, then `fmt` parsing is non-compliant with \"has no effect\" (because it has the effect of destroying alignment info).\n\nSo the fix should ideally be in parsing.\n\nIn `on_zero()`:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nIf we change this to:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    // If alignment is already set, we might want to keep it?\n    // But we need to signal \"numeric padding\".\n    specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nIf we change `align` enum to include `numeric_left`, `numeric_center`?\n`align` is 4 bits, so up to 16 values. Currently used 0-4.\nWe have plenty of space in `align_t`.\n\nSo I can add `numeric_left`, `numeric_right` (redundant with numeric?), `numeric_center`.\n\n`align::numeric` currently behaves like `right` but with special handling in `write_float`.\n\nIf I add `align::numeric_left` (value 5), `align::numeric_center` (value 6).\n\nThen in `on_zero`:\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    if (specs_.align == align::left) specs_.align = align::numeric_left;\n    else if (specs_.align == align::center) specs_.align = align::numeric_center;\n    else specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nThen in `write_float`, I need to handle `numeric_left` and `numeric_center`.\nBut `write_float` logic for `numeric` is:\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric && fspecs.sign) {\n     // write sign\n     // reduce width\n     // set sign to none\n  }\n  // write padded (which uses align::numeric -> right align)\n```\n\nIf `align` is `numeric_left`, `write_padded` needs to handle it.\n`write_padded` uses `shifts` array. I need to update `shifts` array.\n\n`left_padding_shifts`:\n`numeric` (4) -> 0 (left padding).\n`numeric_left` (5) -> 31 (right padding).\n\nSo `numeric_left` would behave like `left` in `write_padded`.\n\nAnd in `write_float`, we treat `numeric_left` same as `numeric` (extract sign).\n\nAnd in `write_nonfinite`:\nIf `align` is `numeric`, change to `right`.\nIf `align` is `numeric_left`, change to `left`.\nIf `align` is `numeric_center`, change to `center`.\n\nThis seems like a viable plan that preserves ABI (assuming `align_t` values are not part of ABI contract in a way that forbids adding new values, and `shifts` arrays are internal).\n\n`align` enum is in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n`shifts` arrays are in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\nLet's check `align` enum again.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric };\n}\n```\n\nI can add `numeric_left`, `numeric_center`.\n\nWait, `align::type` is used in `write_padded` template parameter.\n```cpp\ntemplate <align::type align = align::left, ...>\n```\n\nIf I add values, I need to make sure `write_padded` handles them.\n\n`write_padded` implementation:\n```cpp\n  auto* shifts = align == align::left ? data::left_padding_shifts\n                                      : data::right_padding_shifts;\n  size_t left_padding = padding >> shifts[specs.align];\n```\n\nIt uses `specs.align` to index into `shifts`.\nSo I need to extend `shifts` arrays.\n\n`shifts` arrays are `static constexpr const char`.\n\n```cpp\n  FMT_API static constexpr const char left_padding_shifts[] = {31, 31, 0, 1, 0};\n```\n\nI need to extend them to handle new enum values.\n\nThis seems like a clean solution.\n\nLet's verify where `align` enum is defined. `include/fmt/core.h`.\n\nI will modify `include/fmt/core.h` to add `numeric_left` and `numeric_center`.\nThen modify `include/fmt/format.h` to update `left_padding_shifts` and `right_padding_shifts`.\nThen modify `on_zero` in `include/fmt/core.h` (via `specs_setter` or `dynamic_specs_handler`?).\nWait, `on_zero` is in `specs_setter` in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n\nAnd finally update `write_nonfinite` in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\nAlso need to check if `write_float` needs updates.\n`write_float` checks `specs.align == align::numeric`.\nI should update it to check `specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center`.\n\nOr maybe I can define a helper `is_numeric(align)`.\n\nLet's start by modifying `align` enum.\n\nWait, `align` enum is inside `namespace align`.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric };\n}\n```\n\nI'll add `numeric_left` and `numeric_center`.\n\nBut wait, `write_padded` template parameter `align` defaults to `align::left`.\nThe `align` template parameter is used to select which shift array to use?\nNo, `align` template parameter seems to be optimization or something?\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <align::type align = align::left, typename OutputIt, typename Char,\n          typename F>\nFMT_CONSTEXPR OutputIt write_padded(OutputIt out,\n                                    const basic_format_specs<Char>& specs,\n                                    size_t size, size_t width, F&& f) {\n  static_assert(align == align::left || align == align::right, \"\");\n  // ...\n  auto* shifts = align == align::left ? data::left_padding_shifts\n                                      : data::right_padding_shifts;\n```\n\nThe `align` template parameter is strictly `left` or `right`. It selects the \"base\" alignment logic (left aligned or right aligned output?).\nActually it selects which shift table to use.\n\nIf `align == align::left`, it uses `left_padding_shifts`.\n`left_padding_shifts` defines how much left padding to add for each `specs.align`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `left` (1): `shifts[1]` is 31. `padding >> 31` is 0. So 0 left padding. Correct.\nIf `specs.align` is `right` (2): `shifts[2]` is 0. `padding >> 0` is `padding`. So full left padding. Correct.\n\nSo I just need to add entries to `shifts` arrays.\n\nPlan:\n1. Modify `include/fmt/core.h`: Add `numeric_left`, `numeric_center` to `align::type`.\n2. Modify `include/fmt/core.h`: Update `specs_setter::on_zero` to set `numeric_left`/`numeric_center` if `align` is `left`/`center`.\n3. Modify `include/fmt/format.h`: Update `left_padding_shifts` and `right_padding_shifts` arrays.\n4. Modify `include/fmt/format.h`: Update `write_nonfinite` to handle new align values (map them back to `left`/`center`/`right`).\n5. Modify `include/fmt/format.h`: Update `write_float` (and `write_int`?) to handle new align values (treat them as numeric).\n\nWait, `write_int` also uses `align::numeric`. I should check `write_int` too.\n\nLet's check `write_int` (or `write_integer`).\n\nI'll search for `write_int` or similar.",

So left padding.\n\nWait, `write_padded<align::right>` means `align` template param is `right`.\n`shifts` = `right_padding_shifts`.\n`right_padding_shifts[4]` (numeric) is 0.\n`padding >> 0` is `padding`.\n\nSo `write_padded` adds full padding on the left.\n\nBut `write_int_data` calculates `padding` (numeric padding) and adds it to `size`.\nSo `write_padded` sees `size` equal to `width` (if width > size).\nSo `write_padded` calculates `padding = width - size = 0`.\nSo `write_padded` adds NO padding.\n\nInstead, the callback adds the padding:\n\n```cpp\n        for (unsigned p = prefix & 0xffffff; p != 0; p >>= 8)\n          *it++ = static_cast<Char>(p & 0xff);\n        it = detail::fill_n(it, data.padding, static_cast<Char>('0'));\n        return write_digits(it);\n```\n\nSo `write_int` handles numeric padding manually inside the callback.\n\nSo if I add `numeric_left`, I need to make sure `write_int` treats it as numeric padding?\n\nNo, if I add `numeric_left`, it means \"Left align BUT use zero padding if numeric\".\nBut for integers, `0` flag implies numeric alignment.\n\nIf user writes `\"{:<+06}\"` for integer `1`.\n`align` becomes `numeric`.\n`write_int` sees `numeric`. It calculates padding. It writes prefix, then padding (zeros), then digits.\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nThis is what happens now.\n\nIf I change `on_zero` to preserve alignment:\n`align` becomes `numeric_left`.\n\n`write_int_data` checks `specs.align == align::numeric`. It will be false for `numeric_left`.\nSo `padding` will be 0. `size` will be small.\n\n`write_padded` will be called with `specs.align == numeric_left`.\n`write_padded` uses `right_padding_shifts`.\nI need to set `right_padding_shifts[numeric_left]` to something that produces left alignment (padding on right).\n\n`right_padding_shifts`:\n`left` (1) -> 31 (0 left padding).\n`right` (2) -> 0 (full left padding).\n\nSo `numeric_left` should be 31.\n\nSo `write_padded` will add padding on the right.\nAnd `write_int` callback will write prefix and digits (no zero padding).\nResult: `+1     ` (space padded on right).\n\nWait, `0` flag sets fill to `0`.\nSo `write_padded` will use `0` fill.\nResult: `+100000`.\n\nThis is NOT `+00001`.\n\nSo `\"{:<+06}\"` for integer `1` would become `+100000` if I change `on_zero` to preserve alignment.\n\nIs this correct?\n`\"{:<+06}\"`: Left align, sign `+`, width 6, zero fill.\n`+1` is 2 chars. 4 chars padding.\nLeft align -> padding on right.\nZero fill -> padding is `0`.\nSo `+100000`.\n\nThis seems technically correct interpretation of \"Left align with zero fill\".\n\nBut `fmt` (and `printf`) usually interprets `0` flag as \"numeric alignment\" (padding between sign and digits).\n\nIf `fmt` currently produces `+00001` for `\"{:<+06}\"`, it means it ignores `<`.\n\nIf I change it to produce `+100000`, I am changing behavior for integers too!\n\nIs this desired?\nThe issue is about NaN/Inf.\n\nIf I change `on_zero` to preserve alignment, I change behavior for integers.\n\nIf I want to avoid changing behavior for integers, I must ensure `write_int` still treats `numeric_left` as `numeric`.\n\nIf `write_int_data` checks `specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left`, then it will calculate padding and `size = width`.\nThen `write_padded` will see `size = width`, so 0 padding.\nCallback will write prefix, then zeros, then digits.\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nSo if I update `write_int_data` to handle `numeric_left`, I preserve behavior for integers (it ignores left alignment effectively, because numeric padding takes over).\n\nBut wait, if `write_int_data` handles it, `write_padded` adds NO padding. So alignment in `write_padded` doesn't matter.\n\nSo for integers, `numeric_left` would behave like `numeric`.\n\nNow for floats. `write_float`.\n\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric && fspecs.sign) {\n     // ...\n  }\n```\n\nIf I update this to include `numeric_left`, then `write_float` will also behave like `numeric` (sign extracted, padding handled by `write_padded`?).\n\nWait, `write_float` extracts sign, then calls `write_padded`.\n`write_padded` uses `specs.align`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric`, `write_padded` adds left padding (zeros).\nResult: `+00001.0`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\nIf I set `shifts` for `numeric_left` to be left-aligned (padding on right).\nThen `write_padded` adds right padding (zeros).\nResult: `+1.00000`.\n\nSo for floats, `numeric_left` would produce `+1.00000`.\nCurrent behavior is `+00001.0`.\n\nSo `\"{:<+06}\"` for float `1.0` currently produces `+00001`.\nIf I change it, it produces `+1.0000`.\n\nIs `+00001` correct for `\"{:<+06}\"`?\nUsually `0` flag overrides alignment.\n\nIf I change behavior for floats, I might break users who rely on `0` overriding `<`.\n\nSo I should probably NOT change behavior for finite numbers.\n\nSo `write_float` should treat `numeric_left` as `numeric`?\nIf so, `write_padded` must treat `numeric_left` as `numeric` (left padding).\n\nIf `write_padded` treats `numeric_left` as `numeric`, then `numeric_left` is just an alias for `numeric`.\n\nIf so, why add it?\n\nTo distinguish it in `write_nonfinite`!\n\nIn `write_nonfinite`, if `align` is `numeric_left`, we know the user asked for `<`.\nSo we can switch to `left` alignment (and space fill).\n\nIf `align` is `numeric`, we know the user didn't ask for `<` (or asked for `>`).\nSo we switch to `right` alignment (and space fill).\n\nThis seems to be the solution!\n\nPlan:\n1. Add `numeric_left`, `numeric_center` to `align::type`.\n2. Update `on_zero` to set these values.\n3. Update `shifts` arrays to treat `numeric_left` and `numeric_center` exactly like `numeric` (so finite numbers behavior is preserved).\n4. Update `write_int_data` and `write_float` to treat `numeric_left`/`center` same as `numeric`.\n5. Update `write_nonfinite` to treat `numeric_left` as `left`, `numeric_center` as `center`, and `numeric` as `right`.\n\nThis preserves behavior for numbers (finite floats and ints) but fixes it for NaN/Inf.\n\nLet's verify `shifts` for `numeric`.\n`left_padding_shifts[4]` = 0.\n`right_padding_shifts[4]` = 0.\n\nSo I should set `numeric_left` (5) and `numeric_center` (6) to 0 as well in `shifts` arrays.\n\nWait, `align::center` uses shifts 1.\n\nIf `numeric_center` is used for finite numbers, it should behave like `numeric` (padding between sign and digits).\nNumeric alignment usually implies left padding (right aligned number).\nDoes `printf` support centered numeric alignment? No.\n\nIf user writes `\"{:^+06}\"` (center, sign, zero fill).\nCurrent behavior: `+00001`. (Numeric alignment overrides center).\n\nIf I preserve this behavior, `numeric_center` should behave like `numeric`.\n\nSo yes, `shifts` should be 0 for new values.\n\nAnd `write_int_data` and `write_float` checks need to be updated.\n\nThis seems correct and robust.\n\nLet's start implementing.\n\nStep 1: Modify `include/fmt/core.h` to add enum values.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric };\n}\n```\n\nI'll change it to:\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric, numeric_left, numeric_center };\n}\n```\n\nStep 2: Modify `on_zero` in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    if (specs_.align == align::left) specs_.align = align::numeric_left;\n    else if (specs_.align == align::center) specs_.align = align::numeric_center;\n    else specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nStep 3: Modify `include/fmt/format.h` shifts arrays.\n\n```cpp\n  FMT_API static constexpr const char left_padding_shifts[] = {31, 31, 0, 1, 0};\n```\nto\n```cpp\n  FMT_API static constexpr const char left_padding_shifts[] = {31, 31, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0};\n```\n\nAnd similarly for `right_padding_shifts`.\n\nStep 4: Modify `write_nonfinite` in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    // ...\n    specs.align = align::right;\n  } else if (specs.align == align::numeric_left) {\n    // ...\n    specs.align = align::left;\n  } else if (specs.align == align::numeric_center) {\n    // ...\n    specs.align = align::center;\n  }\n```\n\nStep 5: Modify `write_int_data` and `write_float` checks.\n\nThis involves finding all usages of `align::numeric`.\n\nLet's find usages of `align::numeric`.",

So left padding.\n\nWait, `write_padded<align::right>` means `align` template param is `right`.\n`shifts` = `right_padding_shifts`.\n`right_padding_shifts[4]` (numeric) is 0.\n`padding >> 0` is `padding`.\n\nSo `write_padded` adds full padding on the left.\n\nBut `write_int_data` calculates `padding` (numeric padding) and adds it to `size`.\nSo `write_padded` sees `size` equal to `width` (if width > size).\nSo `write_padded` calculates `padding = width - size = 0`.\nSo `write_padded` adds NO padding.\n\nInstead, the callback adds the padding:\n\n```cpp\n        for (unsigned p = prefix & 0xffffff; p != 0; p >>= 8)\n          *it++ = static_cast<Char>(p & 0xff);\n        it = detail::fill_n(it, data.padding, static_cast<Char>('0'));\n        return write_digits(it);\n```\n\nSo `write_int` handles numeric padding manually inside the callback.\n\nSo if I add `numeric_left`, I need to make sure `write_int` treats it as numeric padding?\n\nNo, if I add `numeric_left`, it means \"Left align BUT use zero padding if numeric\".\nBut for integers, `0` flag implies numeric alignment.\n\nIf user writes `\"{:<+06}\"` for integer `1`.\n`align` becomes `numeric`.\n`write_int` sees `numeric`. It calculates padding. It writes prefix, then padding (zeros), then digits.\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nThis is what happens now.\n\nIf I change `on_zero` to preserve alignment:\n`align` becomes `numeric_left`.\n\n`write_int_data` checks `specs.align == align::numeric`. It will be false for `numeric_left`.\nSo `padding` will be 0. `size` will be small.\n\n`write_padded` will be called with `specs.align == numeric_left`.\n`write_padded` uses `right_padding_shifts`.\nI need to set `right_padding_shifts[numeric_left]` to something that produces left alignment (padding on right).\n\n`right_padding_shifts`:\n`left` (1) -> 31 (0 left padding).\n`right` (2) -> 0 (full left padding).\n\nSo `numeric_left` should be 31.\n\nSo `write_padded` will add padding on the right.\nAnd `write_int` callback will write prefix and digits (no zero padding).\nResult: `+1     ` (space padded on right).\n\nWait, `0` flag sets fill to `0`.\nSo `write_padded` will use `0` fill.\nResult: `+100000`.\n\nThis is NOT `+00001`.\n\nSo `\"{:<+06}\"` for integer `1` would become `+100000` if I change `on_zero` to preserve alignment.\n\nIs this correct?\n`\"{:<+06}\"`: Left align, sign `+`, width 6, zero fill.\n`+1` is 2 chars. 4 chars padding.\nLeft align -> padding on right.\nZero fill -> padding is `0`.\nSo `+100000`.\n\nThis seems technically correct interpretation of \"Left align with zero fill\".\n\nBut `fmt` (and `printf`) usually interprets `0` flag as \"numeric alignment\" (padding between sign and digits).\n\nIf `fmt` currently produces `+00001` for `\"{:<+06}\"`, it means it ignores `<`.\n\nIf I change it to produce `+100000`, I am changing behavior for integers too!\n\nIs this desired?\nThe issue is about NaN/Inf.\n\nIf I change `on_zero` to preserve alignment, I change behavior for integers.\n\nIf I want to avoid changing behavior for integers, I must ensure `write_int` still treats `numeric_left` as `numeric`.\n\nIf `write_int_data` checks `specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left`, then it will calculate padding and `size = width`.\nThen `write_padded` will see `size = width`, so 0 padding.\nCallback will write prefix, then zeros, then digits.\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nSo if I update `write_int_data` to handle `numeric_left`, I preserve behavior for integers (it ignores left alignment effectively, because numeric padding takes over).\n\nBut wait, if `write_int_data` handles it, `write_padded` adds NO padding. So alignment in `write_padded` doesn't matter.\n\nSo for integers, `numeric_left` would behave like `numeric`.\n\nNow for floats. `write_float`.\n\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric && fspecs.sign) {\n     // ...\n  }\n```\n\nIf I update this to include `numeric_left`, then `write_float` will also behave like `numeric` (sign extracted, padding handled by `write_padded`?).\n\nWait, `write_float` extracts sign, then calls `write_padded`.\n`write_padded` uses `specs.align`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric`, `write_padded` adds left padding (zeros).\nResult: `+00001.0`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\nIf I set `shifts` for `numeric_left` to be left-aligned (padding on right).\nThen `write_padded` adds right padding (zeros).\nResult: `+1.00000`.\n\nSo for floats, `numeric_left` would produce `+1.00000`.\nCurrent behavior is `+00001.0`.\n\nSo `\"{:<+06}\"` for float `1.0` currently produces `+00001`.\nIf I change it, it produces `+1.0000`.\n\nIs `+00001` correct for `\"{:<+06}\"`?\nUsually `0` flag overrides alignment.\n\nIf I change behavior for floats, I might break users who rely on `0` overriding `<`.\n\nSo I should probably NOT change behavior for finite numbers.\n\nSo `write_float` should treat `numeric_left` as `numeric`?\nIf so, `write_padded` must treat `numeric_left` as `numeric` (left padding).\n\nIf `write_padded` treats `numeric_left` as `numeric`, then `numeric_left` is just an alias for `numeric`.\n\nIf so, why add it?\n\nTo distinguish it in `write_nonfinite`!\n\nIn `write_nonfinite`, if `align` is `numeric_left`, we know the user asked for `<`.\nSo we can switch to `left` alignment (and space fill).\n\nIf `align` is `numeric`, we know the user didn't ask for `<` (or asked for `>`).\nSo we switch to `right` alignment (and space fill).\n\nThis seems to be the solution!\n\nPlan:\n1. Add `numeric_left`, `numeric_center` to `align::type`.\n2. Update `on_zero` to set these values.\n3. Update `shifts` arrays to treat `numeric_left` and `numeric_center` exactly like `numeric` (so finite numbers behavior is preserved).\n4. Update `write_int_data` and `write_float` to treat `numeric_left`/`center` same as `numeric`.\n5. Update `write_nonfinite` to treat `numeric_left` as `left`, `numeric_center` as `center`, and `numeric` as `right`.\n\nThis preserves behavior for numbers (finite floats and ints) but fixes it for NaN/Inf.\n\nLet's verify `shifts` for `numeric`.\n`left_padding_shifts[4]` = 0.\n`right_padding_shifts[4]` = 0.\n\nSo I should set `numeric_left` (5) and `numeric_center` (6) to 0 as well in `shifts` arrays.\n\nWait, `align::center` uses shifts 1.\n\nIf `numeric_center` is used for finite numbers, it should behave like `numeric` (padding between sign and digits).\nNumeric alignment usually implies left padding (right aligned number).\nDoes `printf` support centered numeric alignment? No.\n\nIf user writes `\"{:^+06}\"` (center, sign, zero fill).\nCurrent behavior: `+00001`. (Numeric alignment overrides center).\n\nIf I preserve this behavior, `numeric_center` should behave like `numeric`.\n\nSo yes, `shifts` should be 0 for new values.\n\nAnd `write_int_data` and `write_float` checks need to be updated.\n\nThis seems correct and robust.\n\nLet's start implementing.\n\nStep 1: Modify `include/fmt/core.h` to add enum values.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric };\n}\n```\n\nI'll change it to:\n```cpp\nnamespace align {\nenum type { none, left, right, center, numeric, numeric_left, numeric_center };\n}\n```\n\nStep 2: Modify `on_zero` in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n\n```cpp\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR void on_zero() {\n    if (specs_.align == align::left) specs_.align = align::numeric_left;\n    else if (specs_.align == align::center) specs_.align = align::numeric_center;\n    else specs_.align = align::numeric;\n    specs_.fill[0] = Char('0');\n  }\n```\n\nStep 3: Modify `include/fmt/format.h` shifts arrays.\n\n```cpp\n  FMT_API static constexpr const char left_padding_shifts[] = {31, 31, 0, 1, 0};\n```\nto\n```cpp\n  FMT_API static constexpr const char left_padding_shifts[] = {31, 31, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0};\n```\n\nAnd similarly for `right_padding_shifts`.\n\nStep 4: Modify `write_nonfinite` in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\n```cpp\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    // ...\n    specs.align = align::right;\n  } else if (specs.align == align::numeric_left) {\n    // ...\n    specs.align = align::left;\n  } else if (specs.align == align::numeric_center) {\n    // ...\n    specs.align = align::center;\n  }\n```\n\nStep 5: Modify `write_int_data` and `write_float` checks.\n\nThis involves finding all usages of `align::numeric`.\n\nLet's find usages of `align::numeric`.",

But `align::numeric` is only set by `0` flag (via `on_zero`).\nWait, `parse_align` doesn't produce `align::numeric`.\nSo `on_align` is only called with `left`, `right`, `center`.\nWait, `on_align` is part of `Handler` interface.\nIf user manually calls `on_align(align::numeric)`, it checks.\nSo I should probably update this check too, just in case.\n\nWait, `align::numeric` is NOT produced by `parse_align`. It is produced by `on_zero`.\n\nSo `on_align` check is probably fine as is, unless `on_zero` calls `on_align`?

But `align::numeric` is only set by `0` flag (via `on_zero`).\nWait, `parse_align` doesn't produce `align::numeric`.\nSo `on_align` is only called with `left`, `right`, `center`.\nWait, `on_align` is part of `Handler` interface.\nIf user manually calls `on_align(align::numeric)`, it checks.\nSo I should probably update this check too, just in case.\n\nWait, `align::numeric` is NOT produced by `parse_align`. It is produced by `on_zero`.\n\nSo `on_align` check is probably fine as is, unless `on_zero` calls `on_align`? No, `on_zero` sets `specs_.align` directly.\n\nSo I need to update:\n1. `align` enum in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n2. `on_zero` in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n3. `check_cstring_type_spec` in `include/fmt/core.h`.\n4. `write_int_data` in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n5. `write_float` in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n6. `write_nonfinite` in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n7. `shifts` arrays in `include/fmt/format.h`.\n\nThis seems like a lot of changes.\n\nIs there a simpler way?\n\nIf I only care about `write_nonfinite`, maybe I can avoid changing `align` enum?\n\nIf I can't change `align` enum, I can't distinguish `numeric` from `numeric_left`.\n\nSo I must change `align` enum.\n\nLet's start with `include/fmt/core.h`.\n\nI'll read `include/fmt/core.h` around `align` enum definition.",

Remove the extra `}`.\n2. Restore `auto size = str_size + (sign ? 1 : 0);`.\n\nThe current code:\n```cpp\n  auto sign = fspecs.sign;\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    // ...\n  } else if (specs.align == align::numeric_center) {\n    // ...\n    specs.align = align::center;\n  }\n  }\n  return write_padded(out, specs, size, ...\n```\n\nWait, `size` is used in `write_padded`. If I deleted definition of `size`, compilation should fail with \"size not declared\".\n\nThe error message was:\n```\ninclude/fmt/format.h:1611:3: error: expected unqualified-id before 'return'\n 1611 |   return write_padded(out, specs, size, [=](reserve_iterator<OutputIt> it) {\n```\n\nThis error usually means we are outside of a function. The extra `}` closed the function `write_nonfinite`.\n\nSo `return ...` is at global scope, which is invalid.\n\nI need to remove the extra `}` and add `auto size = ...`.\n\nI'll rewrite the function body properly.\n\nLines 1596 to 1610 (approx).\n\n```cpp\n  auto sign = fspecs.sign;\n  if (specs.align == align::numeric) {\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == Char('0'))\n      specs.fill[0] = Char(' ');\n    specs.align = align::right;\n  } else if (specs.align == align::numeric_left) {\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == Char('0'))\n      specs.fill[0] = Char(' ');\n    specs.align = align::left;\n  } else if (specs.align == align::numeric_center) {\n    if (specs.fill.size() == 1 && specs.fill[0] == Char('0'))\n      specs.fill[0] = Char(' ');\n    specs.align = align::center;\n  }\n  }\n```\n\nI need to replace `}` with `auto size = str_size + (sign ? 1 : 0);`.\n\nWait, the extra `}` is on line 1610 (in `sed` output above).\n\n```cpp\n1608:    specs.align = align::center;\n1609:  }\n1610:  }\n```\n\nSo I should replace line 1610 with `auto size = str_size + (sign ? 1 : 0);`.\n\nLet's verify line numbers again.",

      "content": "Wait, `Number {:<+06}: '0000+1'`?\nPrevious output was `+00001`.\n\n`0000+1` means padding is on the left, but sign is after padding?\n\nWait, `write_float` logic:\n\n```cpp\n  if ((specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center) && fspecs.sign) {\n    auto it = reserve(out, 1);\n    *it++ = static_cast<Char>(data::signs[fspecs.sign]);\n    out = base_iterator(out, it);\n    fspecs.sign = sign::none;\n    if (specs.width != 0) --specs.width;\n  }\n```\n\nThis writes the sign.\n\nThen `write_padded` is called.\n\nIf `align` is `numeric_left` (5).\n`left_padding_shifts[5]` is 0.\n`right_padding_shifts[5]` is 0.\n\nSo `write_padded` adds full padding on the left.\n\nWait, `write_padded` uses `specs.align`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric_left`, `shifts[5]` is 0.\n`padding >> 0` is `padding`.\nSo `left_padding` is `padding`.\nSo padding is added on the left.\n\nSo `write_float` writes sign `+`.\nThen `write_padded` writes padding `0000`.\nThen `write_float` writes digits `1`.\n\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nSo why did I get `0000+1`?\n\nAh, `write_float` calls `write_float` (recursive) or `write_bytes`?\n\n```cpp\n  memory_buffer buffer;\n  if (fspecs.format == float_format::hex) {\n    // ...\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    // snprintf_float ...\n  }\n  return write_bytes(out, {buffer.data(), buffer.size()}, specs);\n```\n\n`write_bytes` calls `write_padded`.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename Char, typename OutputIt>\nFMT_CONSTEXPR OutputIt write_bytes(OutputIt out, string_view bytes,\n                                   const basic_format_specs<Char>& specs) {\n  return write_padded(out, specs, bytes.size(),\n                      [bytes](reserve_iterator<OutputIt> it) {\n                        const char* data = bytes.data();\n                        return copy_str<Char>(data, data + bytes.size(), it);\n                      });\n}\n```\n\nSo `write_bytes` uses `specs`. `specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\n\nIf `write_float` already wrote the sign, then `specs` passed to `write_bytes` should have width reduced.\n\nBut `write_bytes` uses `specs` passed to it.\n\nWait, `write_float` modifies `specs`?\nNo, `write_float` takes `basic_format_specs<Char> specs` by value.\n\n```cpp\nOutputIt write(OutputIt out, T value, basic_format_specs<Char> specs,\n               locale_ref loc = {}) {\n```\n\nSo `specs` is modified locally.\n\n```cpp\n    if (specs.width != 0) --specs.width;\n```\n\nSo `write_bytes` receives modified `specs`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\n`write_padded` adds padding on left (because `shifts[5]` is 0).\n\nSo `+` (from `write_float` block) then `0000` (from `write_padded`) then `1` (from `write_bytes` callback).\n\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nSo why did I see `0000+1`?\n\nMaybe `write_float` block was NOT executed?\n\n```cpp\n  if ((specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center) && fspecs.sign) {\n```\n\n`fspecs.sign` comes from `specs.sign`.\n\nIn `test_align_zero.cc`: `fmt::format(\"{:<+06}\", 1.0)`.\n`+` sign is present. `fspecs.sign` should be `plus`.\n\nSo the block should be executed.\n\nWait, I might have misread the output.\n\n```\nNumber {:<+06}: '0000+1'\n```\n\nIf `0000+1`, it means padding `0000` came BEFORE sign `+`.\n\nThis implies `write_float` block did NOT write the sign, OR `write_padded` wrote padding before `write_float` wrote sign?\n\nIf `write_float` block executed, it writes sign to `out`.\nThen `write_bytes` writes padding to `out`.\n\nSo `+00001`.\n\nIf I got `0000+1`, it means `write_bytes` wrote padding, then `+1`?\n\nBut `write_bytes` writes `buffer`. `buffer` contains digits.\n\nIf `buffer` contained `+1`, then `write_float` block must NOT have executed (because it sets `fspecs.sign = sign::none`).\n\nIf `write_float` block didn't execute, then `fspecs.sign` is still `plus`.\nThen `snprintf_float` or whatever puts sign in buffer?\n\n`snprintf_float` usually handles sign if `fspecs.sign` is set.\n\nSo if `write_float` block didn't execute, `buffer` has `+1`.\nAnd `write_bytes` pads `+1`.\n`specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\n`write_padded` adds padding on left.\nSo `0000+1`.\n\nSo why didn't `write_float` block execute?\n\n```cpp\n  if ((specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center) && fspecs.sign) {\n```\n\nI updated this line.\n\nMaybe `specs.align` is NOT `numeric_left`?\n\nIn `on_zero`:\n```cpp\n    if (specs_.align == align::left) specs_.align = align::numeric_left;\n```\n\nIn `test_align_zero.cc`: `\"{:<+06}\"`.\n`parse_align` sets `align::left`.\n`on_zero` sets `align::numeric_left`.\n\nSo `specs.align` should be `numeric_left`.\n\nMaybe I messed up the `sed` command for `write_float`?\n\nI used:\n```bash\nsed -i '1803s/specs.align == align::numeric/(specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center)/' include/fmt/format.h\n```\n\nLet's check the file content again.",

                "content": "Wait, `Number {:<+06}: '0000+1'`?\nPrevious output was `+00001`.\n\n`0000+1` means padding is on the left, but sign is after padding?\n\nWait, `write_float` logic:\n\n```cpp\n  if ((specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center) && fspecs.sign) {\n    auto it = reserve(out, 1);\n    *it++ = static_cast<Char>(data::signs[fspecs.sign]);\n    out = base_iterator(out, it);\n    fspecs.sign = sign::none;\n    if (specs.width != 0) --specs.width;\n  }\n```\n\nThis writes the sign.\n\nThen `write_padded` is called.\n\nIf `align` is `numeric_left` (5).\n`left_padding_shifts[5]` is 0.\n`right_padding_shifts[5]` is 0.\n\nSo `write_padded` adds full padding on the left.\n\nWait, `write_padded` uses `specs.align`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric_left`, `shifts[5]` is 0.\n`padding >> 0` is `padding`.\nSo `left_padding` is `padding`.\nSo padding is added on the left.\n\nSo `write_float` writes sign `+`.\nThen `write_padded` writes padding `0000`.\nThen `write_float` writes digits `1`.\n\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nSo why did I get `0000+1`?\n\nAh, `write_float` calls `write_float` (recursive) or `write_bytes`?\n\n```cpp\n  memory_buffer buffer;\n  if (fspecs.format == float_format::hex) {\n    // ...\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    // snprintf_float ...\n  }\n  return write_bytes(out, {buffer.data(), buffer.size()}, specs);\n```\n\n`write_bytes` calls `write_padded`.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename Char, typename OutputIt>\nFMT_CONSTEXPR OutputIt write_bytes(OutputIt out, string_view bytes,\n                                   const basic_format_specs<Char>& specs) {\n  return write_padded(out, specs, bytes.size(),\n                      [bytes](reserve_iterator<OutputIt> it) {\n                        const char* data = bytes.data();\n                        return copy_str<Char>(data, data + bytes.size(), it);\n                      });\n}\n```\n\nSo `write_bytes` uses `specs`. `specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\n\nIf `write_float` already wrote the sign, then `specs` passed to `write_bytes` should have width reduced.\n\nBut `write_bytes` uses `specs` passed to it.\n\nWait, `write_float` modifies `specs`?\nNo, `write_float` takes `basic_format_specs<Char> specs` by value.\n\n```cpp\nOutputIt write(OutputIt out, T value, basic_format_specs<Char> specs,\n               locale_ref loc = {}) {\n```\n\nSo `specs` is modified locally.\n\n```cpp\n    if (specs.width != 0) --specs.width;\n```\n\nSo `write_bytes` receives modified `specs`.\n\nIf `specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\n`write_padded` adds padding on left (because `shifts[5]` is 0).\n\nSo `+` (from `write_float` block) then `0000` (from `write_padded`) then `1` (from `write_bytes` callback).\n\nResult: `+00001`.\n\nSo why did I see `0000+1`?\n\nMaybe `write_float` block was NOT executed?\n\n```cpp\n  if ((specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center) && fspecs.sign) {\n```\n\n`fspecs.sign` comes from `specs.sign`.\n\nIn `test_align_zero.cc`: `fmt::format(\"{:<+06}\", 1.0)`.\n`+` sign is present. `fspecs.sign` should be `plus`.\n\nSo the block should be executed.\n\nWait, I might have misread the output.\n\n```\nNumber {:<+06}: '0000+1'\n```\n\nIf `0000+1`, it means padding `0000` came BEFORE sign `+`.\n\nThis implies `write_float` block did NOT write the sign, OR `write_padded` wrote padding before `write_float` wrote sign?\n\nIf `write_float` block executed, it writes sign to `out`.\nThen `write_bytes` writes padding to `out`.\n\nSo `+00001`.\n\nIf I got `0000+1`, it means `write_bytes` wrote padding, then `+1`?\n\nBut `write_bytes` writes `buffer`. `buffer` contains digits.\n\nIf `buffer` contained `+1`, then `write_float` block must NOT have executed (because it sets `fspecs.sign = sign::none`).\n\nIf `write_float` block didn't execute, then `fspecs.sign` is still `plus`.\nThen `snprintf_float` or whatever puts sign in buffer?\n\n`snprintf_float` usually handles sign if `fspecs.sign` is set.\n\nSo if `write_float` block didn't execute, `buffer` has `+1`.\nAnd `write_bytes` pads `+1`.\n`specs.align` is `numeric_left`.\n`write_padded` adds padding on left.\nSo `0000+1`.\n\nSo why didn't `write_float` block execute?\n\n```cpp\n  if ((specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center) && fspecs.sign) {\n```\n\nI updated this line.\n\nMaybe `specs.align` is NOT `numeric_left`?\n\nIn `on_zero`:\n```cpp\n    if (specs_.align == align::left) specs_.align = align::numeric_left;\n```\n\nIn `test_align_zero.cc`: `\"{:<+06}\"`.\n`parse_align` sets `align::left`.\n`on_zero` sets `align::numeric_left`.\n\nSo `specs.align` should be `numeric_left`.\n\nMaybe I messed up the `sed` command for `write_float`?\n\nI used:\n```bash\nsed -i '1803s/specs.align == align::numeric/(specs.align == align::numeric || specs.align == align::numeric_left || specs.align == align::numeric_center)/' include/fmt/format.h\n```\n\nLet's check the file content again.",
