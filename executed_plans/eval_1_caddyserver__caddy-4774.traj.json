Apply reproduction patch (Epic: Fix fmt::sprintf ignoring minus flag for char)\n\n#### Description\n\nApply the test patch provided in `tasks/task_1_fmtlib_fmt.csv` to `test/printf-test.cc`. This will introduce the failing test cases:\n- `EXPECT_PRINTF(\"7    \", \"%-5d\", 7);`\n- `EXPECT_PRINTF(\"97   \", \"%-5hhi\", 'a');`\n- `EXPECT_PRINTF(\"a    \", \"%-5c\", 'a');`\n\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): N/A\n    - current (in progress task): Apply reproduction patch <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Confirm bug reproduction\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nThis task involves setting up the reproduction case for the reported issue. You need to apply a patch provided in a CSV file to the test suite.\n\n##### Steps:\n1.  Read the file `tasks/task_1_fmtlib_fmt.csv`.\n2.  Extract the patch or code changes specified for `test/printf-test.cc`.\n3.  Apply these changes to `test/printf-test.cc`. This should introduce a new test case (likely named `PrintfTest.MinusFlag` or similar) that asserts the behavior of the minus flag with `char` types.\n\n##### Deliverables:\n- Modified `test/printf-test.cc` containing the new test cases:\n    - `EXPECT_PRINTF(\"7    \", \"%-5d\", 7);`\n    - `EXPECT_PRINTF(\"97   \", \"%-5hhi\", 'a');`\n    - `EXPECT_PRINTF(\"a    \", \"%-5c\", 'a');`\n\n##### Files to read:\n- `tasks/task_1_fmtlib_fmt.csv`\n- `test/printf-test.cc`\n\n##### Files to modify:\n- `test/printf-test.cc`\n\n\n### 2. Fix fmt::sprintf ignoring minus flag for char\n\n#### Description\n\nThe goal is to fix a bug in `fmt::sprintf` where the minus flag (left-alignment) is ignored for `char` types.\nThe plan involves reproducing the issue with the provided patch, locating the defect in `include/fmt/printf.h` (inferred location), and implementing a fix.\n\n\n\n### 3. Confirm bug reproduction (Epic: Fix fmt::sprintf ignoring minus flag for char)\n\n#### Description\n\nBuild and run the tests to confirm that `PrintfTest.MinusFlag` fails.\nExpected failure: The output for char formatting will be right-aligned instead of left-aligned.\nCommand (typical): `cmake . && make && test/printf-test` or `ctest -R PrintfTest.MinusFlag`\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Apply reproduction patch\n    - current (in progress task): Confirm bug reproduction <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Analyze printf implementation\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nNow that the reproduction test case has been applied, you need to confirm that it fails as expected.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Build the project using CMake and Make (or standard build tools available in the environment).\n- [ ] Run the specific test case added in the previous step (e.g., `ctest -R PrintfTest.MinusFlag` or by running the test binary directly).\n- [ ] Verify that the test fails.\n- [ ] Analyze the failure output. The failure should demonstrate that the output is right-aligned (default) instead of left-aligned (minus flag), e.g., expecting `\"a    \"` but getting `\"    a\"`.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] The build completes successfully.\n- [ ] The test `PrintfTest.MinusFlag` is executed.\n- [ ] The test fails specifically on the assertion for the `char` type with the minus flag.\n\n\n### 4. Analyze printf implementation (Epic: Fix fmt::sprintf ignoring minus flag for char)\n\n#### Description\n\nLocate the implementation of `sprintf` and `printf` formatting in the codebase.\nBased on standard fmtlib structure, this is likely in `include/fmt/printf.h`.\nIdentify the code path that handles the `%c` specifier and why it ignores the alignment flag.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Confirm bug reproduction\n    - current (in progress task): Analyze printf implementation <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Implement fix in source code\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nAnalyze the codebase to locate the defect causing the test failure.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Locate the implementation of `sprintf` and its underlying formatting logic in `include/fmt/printf.h`.\n- [ ] Trace how the `%c` specifier is parsed and formatted.\n- [ ] Identify where the alignment flags (specifically the minus flag) are handled for other types versus `char`.\n- [ ] Determine why the alignment logic is skipped or ignored for `char`.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] The specific function or code block responsible for formatting `char` in `printf` context is identified.\n- [ ] The reason for the missing left-alignment is understood (e.g., missing branch, incorrect flag check, or direct character write bypassing padding logic).\n\n##### Files to read:\n- `include/fmt/printf.h`\n\n\n### 5. Implement fix in source code (Epic: Fix fmt::sprintf ignoring minus flag for char)\n\n#### Description\n\nModify the code in `include/fmt/printf.h` (or relevant file) to ensure that when `char` is formatted with the minus flag (e.g., `%-5c`), it is correctly left-aligned.\nEnsure that existing flags (width, etc.) are still respected.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Analyze printf implementation\n    - current (in progress task): Implement fix in source code <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Verify fix with reproduction test\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nImplement the fix for the `sprintf` minus flag bug.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n- [ ] Modify `include/fmt/printf.h` (or the file identified in the previous analysis).\n- [ ] Ensure that when a `char` is formatted with the minus flag (e.g., `%-5c`), the output is padded to the right (left-aligned).\n- [ ] Ensure that standard width formatting still applies (e.g., `%5c` should still be right-aligned).\n- [ ] Ensure no changes break existing functionality for other types or standard `printf` behavior.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n- [ ] The code explicitly handles left-alignment for character formatting in `sprintf`.\n\n##### Files to modify:\n- `include/fmt/printf.h`\n\n\n### 6. Verify fix with reproduction test (Epic: Fix fmt::sprintf ignoring minus flag for char)\n\n#### Description\n\nRun the specific test case `PrintfTest.MinusFlag` again to verify that the fix works.\nThe test should now pass, producing left-aligned output for the char cases.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Implement fix in source code\n    - current (in progress task): Verify fix with reproduction test <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): Run full regression tests\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nVerify that the fix for `fmt::sprintf` (ignoring minus flag for char) works as expected.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n  - [ ] Rebuild the project if necessary (ensure changes from the fix are compiled).\n  - [ ] Run the specific test case `PrintfTest.MinusFlag`.\n    - Command (typical): `ctest -R PrintfTest.MinusFlag` or `./test/printf-test` with appropriate filtering.\n  - [ ] Verify that the test output indicates **PASS**.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n  - [ ] `PrintfTest.MinusFlag` passes successfully.\n  - [ ] The output for the char cases is left-aligned (implied by the test passing).\n\n##### Dependencies:\n  - The fix must be implemented in the source code (Task 15).\n  - The reproduction test must exist in `test/printf-test.cc` (Task 12).\n\n\n### 7. Run full regression tests (Epic: Fix fmt::sprintf ignoring minus flag for char)\n\n#### Description\n\nRun the full test suite to ensure that the changes didn't break any other functionality in the library.\n\n#### Prompt\n\n<general>\nThese instructions are for a task that is part of a larger plan:\n    <plan>\n    - previous (completed): Verify fix with reproduction test\n    - current (in progress task): Run full regression tests <-\n    - upcoming (not yet): N/A\n    </plan>\nWithin reason, stick to only the deliverables outlined in these instructions,\ndon't do extra work, and instead assume anything not mentioned is out of scope.\n</general>\n\nRun the full regression test suite to ensure the changes to `fmt::sprintf` did not break existing functionality.\n\n##### Implementation Checklist:\n  - [ ] Build the full project to ensure all tests are up to date.\n  - [ ] Run the complete test suite.\n    - Command (typical): `ctest` or `make test`.\n  - [ ] Review the output for any failures.\n\n##### Success Criteria:\n  - [ ] All tests in the suite pass (100% tests passed).\n  - [ ] No new errors or regressions are reported.\n\n##### Dependencies:\n  - The fix must be verified on the specific test case first (Task 16).\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\n\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n<IMPORTANT>This is an interactive process where you will think and issue AT LEAST ONE command, see the result, then think and issue your next command(s).</important>\n\nFor each response:\n\n1.

It then adds\\n// the listener address to the map value returned by this function, with\\n// the first server block as one of its associations.\\n//\\n// It then iterates each key on the second server block and associates them\\n// with one or more listener addresses.
