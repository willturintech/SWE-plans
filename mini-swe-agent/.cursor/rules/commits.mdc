description: "Guidance on commit messages"
---

Use the following format for commit messages:

- `ci: description` for all testing related changes, and changes to github workflows etc.
- `dev: description` for development related changes, including updates to the cursor or claude rules
- `fix(component): description` for bug fixes
- `feat(component): description` for new features
- `enh(component): description` for enhancements
- `docs: description` for documentation
- `ref(component): description` for refactoring
- `chore: description` for maintenance tasks (pre-commit hooks, imports, etc.)

Generally, the description should focus on the intent of the changes, not the implementation details.

## Style notes

<IMPORTANT>Do **NOT** add "Co-authored-by: Cursor" lines to the commit message or to the trailer.</IMPORTANT>

## Reviewing

While preparing the commit message, flag critical issues that should be addressed before committing. Do not flag style issues or minor changes.

Flag the following:

- Anything that might raise an unhandled exception in an unintentional manner
- Anything that looks logically wrong or inconsistent
- Breaking changes to protocols/interfaces without corresponding updates to implementations

Flag the following style issue as minor:

- Imports not at top of file
